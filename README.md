# The Shallow Water Equations: Derivation and Numerical Simulation

## Damyn Chipman

## Advanced Fluid Mechanics Final Project

### Overview

This repo contains the write up and code for this final project. We derive the shallow water equations from the incompressible Navier-Stokes, describe a finite volume scheme for use on an unstructured mesh, and present two numerical simulations for verification and validation. More details can be found in the project write up `ProjectWriteUp.pdf`.
