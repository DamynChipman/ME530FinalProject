    "The Shallow Water Equations (SWEs) model the free surface flow of a shallow fluid. The term \"shallow\" refers to an explicit assumption made in the formulation of the model that assumes the horizontal length scale is much larger than the veritcal height of the fluid. The SWEs can be derived from the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations by making the aforementioned assumption and depth integrating over the vertical momentum equation. The SWEs have been used to model tsunami wave development as well as debris flow on land.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SWEs form a hyperbolic system of partial differential equations (PDEs). They can also be expressed in a conservative form. As such, it is common to use a finite volume method to simulate the dynamics of the system. Finite volume methods can accurately model conservative, hyperbolic systems on complicated geometries.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will study the shallow water equations by deriving them from the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, and then simulate the system with a finite volume method on an unstructured mesh. We then present \"flud dynamics in a box\" simulations to verify both the numerical method and conservative nature of the SWEs."

    "\n",
    "The last piece we need to consider before we can simulate the SWEs is how to handle source term. There are various situations. If there is no bathymetry (i.e., the floor is level), then there is no source term and we ignore it. If we have a bathymetry field (time independent), we need to compute the gradient of the bathymetry field and then can use the source average to add the bathymetry contribution each time step at the cell center. Other source terms that could be included in a potential simulation are floor fricition contributions or time dependent additions to the field (i.e., water pouring into or coming out of the field, an impulse injection into the field, etc.). For any of these considerations, we will detail how to include the source term with the respective simulation."

For mass conservation, this is as simple as setting $q_i^{(1)} = q_j^{(1)}$, where $q_i$ is the boundary cell, $q_j$ refers to the 'neighbor'/boundary cell, and the superscript refers to the first variable in the state vector (in this case $h$)."

    "Note: my original intention was to write a mesh reader, the finite volume scheme, and any visualization in C++. However, trying to install and use various software packages (VTK, VTK-m, libmesh, etc.) to read in a `.vtk` file took too long for me to finish for the purpose of this project. As such, I adjusted some Matlab code from a numerical methods in hyperbolic conservation law course. The code will be available with this submission, and I do intend to continue working on the C++ code for research and enthuiast purposes. I want to write a program that works on `.vtk` files that I can generate with a number of mesh/geometry generation tools (gmsh is a great, free example), constructs a mesh object, and employs the finite volume scheme described above to simulate the shallow water equations (or other hyperbolic conservation laws, i.e., gas dynamics, shock waves, etc.). I want to use `.vtk` files becuase they can be imported into ParaView for super cool visualizations.\n",

Briggs, et al. perform an experiment with a wave pool that introduces a wave across one boundary, with a cone shaped island in the middle of the wave pool. Probes are set at different locations and the height of the water is monitored through the experiment. This simulation is the start of this validation; next steps are to introduce bathymetry and keep track of the water height at the locations of the probe. This work is ongoing."

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we derived the shallow water equations from the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, described a finite volume scheme for use on an unstructured mesh, and then simulated the shallow water equations with this scheme in Matlab. The shallow water equations are used to simulate incompressible fluids in domains where the horizontal length scale is much larger than the vertical fluid height. The SWEs are a free surface model. The finite volume scheme we implemented is a 1st order accurate Rusanov flux that works on a mesh of polygons. We use a triangular mesh for the simulations. Finally, we look at two simulations, one of an initial Gaussian distribution in a box and track the mass for verification, and one of a wave being introduced into the domain from the boundary. These simulations form the foundation for additional simulations. Next steps would be to introduce bathymetry, introduce floor friction, solve on more complex geometries, and add higher order physics to improve the model. Indeed, this is part of my current PhD research: to look at solvers for a shallow water model with an added dispersive term to the source term."
